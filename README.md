# Obsidian Workout Log

 > Status: **In development**

Welcome to the Obsidian Workout Log plugin! 🏋🏻‍♀️ 

This tool is here to help you track your **workouts** in Obsidian. With a custom code block and simple syntax, it's easy to record your **exercises**. Even better, I have new features in the pipeline, including **analytics, summaries, progress tracking**, and more.

## Why I created this plugin

Over the years, I've tried various ways to keep track of my gym progress. From physical notebooks to mobile apps and even iPhone notes, there are pros and cons to each method. But there's one thing they all have in common: they're separate from Obsidian.

Now, if you're like me and use Obsidian every day, you'll understand the desire to consolidate everything into this one powerful tool. That's why I started logging my workout sets in Obsidian notes. Over time, I realized that I wanted to make some tasks easier and more automated. So, I created a custom code block plugin that turns my input into simple HTML tables. I'm actively working on additional features to help you track your fitness progress effectively. Stay tuned for updates! 🏋️‍♂️💪
